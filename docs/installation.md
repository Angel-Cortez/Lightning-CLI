# Installation

The recommended way to install the Lightning-CLI is as a _global_ package.
You can install the latest version of the Lightning-CLI by running the following command:

```bash
npm install -g rdkcentral/Lightning-CLI
```

After this you will be able to call the Lightning-CLI anywhere on your machine via the `lng` command.

Try it out by running:

```bash
lng -V
```

This should print out which version of the Lightning-CLI you have installed.
