# Upload command

_Upload the Lightning App to the Metrological Back Office to be published in an App Store_

```bash
lng upload
```

When you're finished developing your App you can choose to upload your App to the Metrological Back Office
so it can be published to an operators App Store.

_Note: you will need to create an account to upload Apps to the Metrological Back Office (http://dashboard.metrological.com/)_

The `lng upload` command takes care of the entire process of uploading. It will ask you for a valid API-key in order
to authenticate your account. It will then build and bundle up your App and upload it to the Metrological Back Office.

_**Note**: Run this command in the root folder of your Lightning App_
