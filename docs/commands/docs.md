# Docs command

_Open the Lightning-SDK documentation_

```bash
lng docs
```

The `lng docs` command can be used whenever you need to review the _Lightning-SDK_ documentation for the App you are currently developing.

It's important to realize that the _Lightning-SDK_ documentation is _version controlled_. The `lng docs` command will open
a local webserver with the documentation matching the _exact_ SDK version the App is using.

_**Note**: Run this command in the root folder of your Lightning App_
