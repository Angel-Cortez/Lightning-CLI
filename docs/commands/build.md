# Build command

_Build a local development version of the Lightning App_

```bash
lng build
```

The `lng build` command is used to build a version of your App targetted at _local development_.

The built App will be created in the `build` folder inside your App folder.

_Note that in older versions of the Lightning-CLI (< 1.6.0) the build command would create the built App version in the `dist` folder)_

The App version generated by the `lng build` command is intended to simulate the Metrological AppStore during local development.
For example, it loads the appBundle asynchronously and makes an API request to`settings.json` used for App configuration, similar
to the boot process of the Metrological AppStore.

If you want to use your app _outside_ the context of the Metrological AppStore, you might also be interested in the [`lng dist`](commands/dist.md) command.

_**Note**: Run this command in the root folder of your Lightning App_
