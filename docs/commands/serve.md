# Serve command

_Start a local webserver and run a built Lightning App in a web browser_

```bash
lng serve
```

The `lng serve` command starts a local webserver and runs an App built with the `lng build` command from the `build` folder.

By default the local webserver launches on the next available port starting at `8080` and opens a browser window with your App.

_**Note**: Run this command in the root folder of your Lightning App_
