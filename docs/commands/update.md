# Update

*Update the Lightning CLI to the latest version*

```
lng update
```

The Lightning CLI has an *auto-update* mechanism. It checks periodically if you are still using the latest version
and, if you are not, updates automatically. This ensures that you are always compatible with the latest
changes (either triggered by changes in the Lightning SDK side or in the Metrological Dashboard).

If you want to manually *force* an update to the latest version, use the `lng update` command.
