# Update command

_Update the Lightning-CLI to the latest version_

```bash
lng update
```

The Lightning-CLI has an auto-update mechanism. It check periodically if you are still on the latest version,
and updates automatically if you are not. This way you can be sure that you are always compatible with the latest
changes (either on the Lightning-SDK side, or the Metro App store side).

When you don't want to wait, but force an update to the latest version manually you can use the `lng update` command.
