# Create command

_Create a new Lightning App_

```bash
lng create
```

The `lng create` command helps you to quickly kickstart a new App.

An interactive prompt will take you through a series of steps and choices.
Based on your input it will generate a complete _blueprint_ App, with the correct file and folder structure for
a new Lightning App (following the Lightning-SDK standard setup).

Once created you are ready to start developing your App!
